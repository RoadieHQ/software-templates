These are the docs for the ${{ values.website_name | title }} website.

This is where you would put information about getting started with the website, maybe how
to authenticate etc.


It's just normal markdown. For example, you can write code blocks here like this:

```js

const myFunction = () => {
  return 'Hello World';
};
```

When you add a new docs file, be sure to update the `mkdocs.yml` file in this repo to
display the file in the sidebar.
